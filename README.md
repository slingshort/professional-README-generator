## Credits
These are the sites I used to create a lisence badge and read more information about lisences. I also found a public GitHub repo later in my development which already included markdowns of lisence badges:
- https://shields.io/category/license
- https://choosealicense.com/licenses/
- https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba
Professional README guide:
- https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide
NPM enquirer docs
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#prompt

MDN web docs was also used frequently for troubleshooting specific functions.

## Info
This project was completed as part of homework assignments.
Main difficulties:
- Bugs due to mispelling of lisence
- Rendering lisence section correctly
